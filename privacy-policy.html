  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 30, 2025</p>

  <p>Ultimate Streamer ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> We do not collect personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or phone number.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous information about how you use the app, including:
      <ul>
        <li>which screens you view,</li>
        <li>parameters of live streams (e.g. resolution, framerate, platform),</li>
        <li>features you use (e.g. overlays, timers),</li>
        <li>error events during streaming,</li>
        <li>device type, operating system, and country.</li>
      </ul>
      This data is not linked to your identity and does not include email, IP address, advertising identifiers, or any other personal data.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Media Access:</strong> We may request access to your camera, microphone, and photo library for live streaming functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> When you use features like YouTube or Facebook streaming, we may receive minimal data from those services, in accordance with their own privacy policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and improve app features</li>
    <li>To support video streaming and user experience</li>
    <li>To monitor performance and fix errors</li>
    <li>To respond to customer support requests</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    We use anonymous analytics tools (such as Firebase Analytics) to understand how the app is used and to improve stability and performance.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data collected is not linked to any personal information.</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics for targeted advertising.</li>
    <li>Analytics collection is limited to app usage events and technical diagnostics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Usage data is only processed in aggregate form for analytics and performance monitoring. It is not shared with advertisers or third parties unrelated to app functionality.
  </p>
  <p>We only share your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>As required by law</li>
    <li>With third-party services strictly for operating the app (e.g. YouTube API, Facebook SDK)</li>
    <li>With your consent</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Google User Data & OAuth Disclosure</h2>
<p>
Ultimate Streamer integrates with Google APIs to provide YouTube streaming functionality. As part of this, the app may request access to your Google account via OAuth 2.0. This access is limited to the following scopes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>youtube.readonly:</strong> to view your YouTube account’s basic streaming settings</li>
  <li><strong>youtube:</strong> to create and manage live broadcasts and uploaded videos</li>
  <li><strong>youtube.force-ssl:</strong> to update video metadata and stream status securely</li>
</ul>
<p>
We use this data exclusively to allow you to stream content to your own YouTube account. We do <strong>not</strong> use your YouTube OAuth data for analytics, advertising, or any unrelated purposes.
</p>
<p>
Ultimate Streamer does <strong>not</strong> store your YouTube credentials or access tokens on our servers. All authentication is handled securely through Google’s official OAuth mechanism.
</p>
<p>
We comply with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
</p>

  <h2>5.1 Google Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
When you use Ultimate Streamer features that integrate with Google or YouTube services, the processing of your data is also governed by Google’s Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
You can review Google’s Privacy Policy here:
<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy
</a>
</p>

  <h2>5.2 Data Deletion and Revoking Google Access</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Data deletion:</strong> Ultimate Streamer does not store or persist Google or YouTube user data obtained via OAuth in any long-term storage, either on our servers or on your device. Authorized data is used only temporarily in your device’s memory (RAM) to enable the active streaming session and is automatically cleared when the session ends (for example, when streaming stops or the app is closed).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Revoking access:</strong> You may revoke Ultimate Streamer’s access to your Google account at any time through Google’s security settings page:
  <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions
  </a>
</p>

  <h2>6. Data Protection and Security</h2>
<p>
We take the protection of your data seriously. Ultimate Streamer does not store or persist any sensitive user data obtained through Google OAuth. All access tokens are handled securely via industry-standard mechanisms provided by iOS and are used only in-memory for the duration of your session.
</p>
<p>
We do not share, log, or transmit your Google account data to any third-party services. Access to YouTube APIs is performed directly from your device, using secure HTTPS connections.
</p>
<p>
In the event of a data breach, we will notify affected users and the relevant authorities as required by law.
</p>
<p>
You may contact us at <strong>d.babych@gmail.com</strong> if you have concerns about your data or wish to request additional details.
</p>
  
<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
  Ultimate Streamer is designed to minimize data handling and does not retain Google or YouTube authorized data beyond the duration required to provide the streaming functionality.
